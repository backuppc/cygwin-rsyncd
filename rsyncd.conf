# Allow rsync to change the root directory to the module location
# upon connection of a client. This is disabled for Win32 as we do
# not provide a full Cygwin environment.

# Warning: with a setting of "false", absolute symlinks will be
# stripped of their leading "/".  See "use chroot" in the rsyncd.conf
# man page.  This is relevant for machines that support symlinks
# (WinXX machines do not).

# this to '1' should be sufficient for BackupPC.
